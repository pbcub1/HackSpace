Do you have ideas for websites that you want to spread and open source collabrative behind? Do you just want to explore what you can do? This project is just to let you mess around with projects.

Folder structure:
---------------
The folders are organized into projects, libraries, and any other way you can think of. In the projects folder, there are sub-folders for other each project. If you want to create another project, simply create another folder inside the projects folder. Libraries are for libraries that you may want to use in your project. If you have another library for people to use, simply create another folder in the libraries folder. With every library or project you create, it is recommended that you add a readme.md in the project or library folder explaining how to use a library or what the project is meant to do.

Project Structure:
------------------
The structure of a project is honestly up to the creator. If you want to have contributors code a certain way, please include this in a readme.md in the root of your project folder. Other things that might go in this fill would be values, ethics, goal, reason for starting, problem, etc. Your readme.md file is basically the "what's going on" in your project.
