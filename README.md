Folder structure:
---------------
The folders are organized into projects, libraries, and any other way you can think of. In the projects folder, there are sub-folders for other each project. If you want to create another project, simply create another folder inside the projects folder. Libraries are for libraries that you may want to use in your project. If you have another library for people to use, simply create another folder in the libraries folder. With every library or project you create, it is recommended that you add a readme.md in the project or library folder explaining how to use a library or what the project is meant to do.
